# .dotfiles
This is a personal dotfile management script designed to work with **bash**, **stow** and **curl**. 

## Usage:
- install with `git clone http://github.com/kmitab/.dotfiles` in your home directory,
- run `~/.dotfiles/stow.sh` to activate.

If this is your first time using stow:
- roughly speaking, it manages files using symlinks,
- it will not overwrite existing files with symlinks.
